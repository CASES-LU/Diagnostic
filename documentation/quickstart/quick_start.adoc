== Diagnostic quick start guide

=== Introduction

Your organization processes sensitive data every day. As a manager, you have an obligation to establish specific security procedures (behavioral, organizational and technical) to protect this data. Moreover, these procedures must address the fundamental principles of necessity and proportionality.
Identifying the best measures and defining the level of effectiveness required for each measure is a highly complex task. The CASES Diagnostic supports you in this process.

HOW?
Using the dedicated questionnaire, this tool will help you :
+ Identify vulnerabilities.
+ Evaluate the security level of information systems.
+ Issue recommendations.
