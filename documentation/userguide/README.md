First connexion and Password change
===================================

![Connexion Screen](img/UG_Diagnostic_001.PNG)

The first step to do is to change the password. For that, just click on
the ‘Forgotten your Password?’ link, and put the mail which should be on
the database.

![Forgotten Your Password](img/UG_Diagnostic_002.PNG)

Then mail will be sent to you.

![Mail Send](img/UG_Diagnostic_003.PNG)

By clicking the link ‘NEW PASSWORD’ in the mail, you will get into a
page where you can change your password. You only need to put the new
one into the two text fields, and then just click on the ‘Change
Password’ button. If the mailing address is not found on the database,
the mail will not be sent.

![Change Password](img/UG_Diagnostic_004.PNG)

Then, you just need to create your first own diagnosis. For that, just
log in to the main connexion screen, by giving your mail and your new
password. Then, just click on the ‘Log in’ button.

> **Warning**

> If you are on the Virtual Machine, you will NOT have any mail server

Begin a Diagnosis as a User
============================

![Main Page – Information about organization](img/UG_Diagnostic_005.PNG)

On the header, at the right side (**1.** on the picture), you can set,
by clicking on the corresponding button, your language (**English** and
**French** are the two only choices right now). You can also disconnect
by clicking on the ‘Log out’ button. Also, if you are administrator of
the application, you should see the admin menu access button near the
red button use to disconnect.

On the top of the screen but below the header, at left, you could see a
button where you could just resume form an old diagnosis (**2.** on the
picture).

Just below, there is the navigation panel (**3.** on the picture), which
we will describe just a little later. Same for the three buttons used to
get the report, save the current diagnosis or the current questions (**4.** on the picture).

Finally, on the right of the screen, there is a free-text panel, where
you should put some text which will be in the report (**5.** on the
picture). Most of the time, the introduction is used to give the context
of this diagnosis, and some info that could be useful when you read the
report. You can also put the activity of the organization, and its number
of employees.

![Main Page – Information about organization with
text](img/UG_Diagnostic_006.PNG)

Then, to save your work, you should just hit ‘Record and continue’. In
the navigation panel, the theme should be green to indicate that there
is already some text.

The summary, which is the last part of the Diagnosis, is a short
description of the most important points in it. The most important
recommendations, what should be done next…

Those are the only free text fields which are present.

After saving the first information, you will be redirected to the first
question.

As you can see in the navigation panel, there are eight big themes,
which can contain some questions. The red color is mainly used on the
theme where you currently are. The question which is black and bold is
the current one. The green one is saved and contains text. By clicking
on the main theme, question about it will appear, and then you can go on
the questions by clicking on them.

The red cross near the question is to delete the question for this
diagnosis.

> **Warning**
>
> If you make a new one, the question will appear again. If you want
> to make it disappear for all diagnosis that you make, you should just
> go in the administration panel to delete it.

![Main Page – Navigation Panel](img/UG_Diagnostic_007.PNG)

You can also add questions by clicking the red ![+ Add a
question](img/UG_Diagnostic_008.PNG) button.

> **Warning**
>
> Be careful, when you do add a question this way, it will be only last
> during this diagnosis. If you want to add a question for all your
> diagnosis, you should add it in the administration part.

![Add Question](img/UG_Diagnostic_009.PNG)

You will have the question field to add the question as it will appear
into the report. The info field is for details which are displayed only
for the question creator. It’s useful to add details to the question, or
have a reminder of the main points to talk about.

The threshold is a little more difficult to use. To put it simply, this
is the multiplication of the threat and weight of the question in the category.

Let’s take an example:

Imagine you need a specific question on the BYOD, and you think this
should be really important. Moreover you have, in the same category,
a question less important.

If the threshold are respectively 10 (threat 2 * weight 5 for example)
and 5 (threat 1 * weight 5 for example), then the maturity on a level
is calculated this way: ((10/3 x maturity) + (5/3 x maturity))
where the maturity could be 0 if not managed, 1 if more or less managed
and 2 if managed. So if a policy is more or less managed about BYOD and
the other question is managed, the category will be ((15/3 x 1) + (10/3 x 2))
= 5 + 6 = 11 out of 16 (The maximal possible) of maturity for this category.

> **Tip**
>
> The maturity can also be not applicable, i.e. the question is not appropriate
> for the enterprise. Thereby, the question is not calculated in the final result.

Finally, just hit the green ‘Add’ button to add your new question and
get back on the main page.

![Main Page – First Question](img/UG_Diagnostic_010.PNG)

On the right side, there is a text field ‘Note’ where you can put what
you have seen, what has been said during the interview, precision about
what you want…

The maturity panel is where you can set the current maturity on a scale
of four levels (managed, more or less managed, not managed and not applicable).
You will also have some reminders to think when you ask the question,
what you should have in mind when you asking it, and what kind of answer you
should have.

The maturity target panel is the maturity level that the company should
have. It’s not necessarily managed, so the information security could be
adapted from a company to another.

The recommendation panel is the place where you could just put what the
company should do to have a better information security.

Finally, the gravity panel is to determine how much the recommendation
should be quickly implemented. For saving, as before, just hit ‘Record
and continue’.

Administration Panel
====================

User Tab
--------

There are six tabs (On the blue header), the first one is for Users, and the other are for
Questions, Categories, Languages, Reports and Settings.

The translation key is mainly used to link questions through all
languages. The category is, of course, the main theme linked, and the
threshold could be assimilated to the maturity that will bring a managed
control. The 'Blocking question' column is a way to know if a question
is essential for the organization and must be managed. If a blocking
question is not managed, it will be displayed in red in the report
to highlight it as a problem for the entity. To finish, the ‘action’
column represents the possibility to edit the question (by clicking the pen
(![Pen](img/UG_Diagnostic_012.PNG))) or delete it (by clicking the cross
(![Cross](img/UG_Diagnostic_013.PNG))).

Above the tab, there is a section in which you can upload the current
questions and categories or export them in a json format.

![Administration Panel – QuestionsJson](img/UG_Diagnostic_049.PNG)

As you can see in this screenshot there is the first category which

report as a ‘.docx’.

![Report Screen](img/UG_Diagnostic_026.PNG)

The first graph that you can see is the maturity by domains with the risk
cartography and more precisely with the tab on the right. The colors determine
the level of maturity of each category (red when maturity is under 33%, orange
between 33% and 66% and green over 66%). If a category is highlighted in orange,
it means that it contains a blocking question which is not managed.
You will also find the recommendation tab which briefly summarizes the
recommendations, their gravity and their current and target maturity.
