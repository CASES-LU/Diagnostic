== First connection and Password change

image::UG_Diagnostic_001.PNG[Connection Screen]

The first step to do is to change the password. For that, just click on the ‘Forgotten your Password?’ link, and put the mail which should be on the database.

image::UG_Diagnostic_002.PNG[Forgotten Your Password]

Then mail will be sent to you.

image::UG_Diagnostic_003.PNG[Mail Send]

By clicking the link ‘NEW PASSWORD’ in the mail, you will get into a page where you can change your password. You only need to put the new one into the two text fields, and then just click on the ‘Change Password’ button. If the mailing address is not found on the database, the mail will not be sent.

image::UG_Diagnostic_004.PNG[Change Password]

Then, you just need to create your first own diagnosis. For that, just log in to the main connection screen, by giving your mail and your new password. Then, just click on the ‘Log in’ button.

WARNING: If you are on the Virtual Machine, you will NOT have any mail server installed by default. So you wont receive any mail unless you install one. You can also use a script included in the virtual machine to change manually a password of any user [_Path_to_Diagnostic_]/scripts/changePassword.sh

TIP: This script should be used only in a closed environment which does not have a network connection. This script needs to have the username of the user that wants to change his password. (Ex: `./changePassword.sh "diagnostic@cases.lu"`). The password needs to have at least a lower case, an upper case, a digit and a special char, and at least 8 characters.

== Begin a diagnosis as a User

image::UG_Diagnostic_005.PNG[Main Page – Information about organization]

On the header, at the right side (**1.** on the picture), you can set, by clicking on the corresponding button, your language (**English** and **French** are the two only choice right now). You can also disconnect by clicking on the ‘Log out’ button. Also, if you are administrator of the application, you should see the admin menu access button near the red button use to disconnect.

On the top of the screen but below the header, at left, you could see a button where you could just resume form an old diagnosis (**2.** on the picture).

Just below, there is the navigation panel (**3.** on the picture), which we will describe just a little later. Same for the two buttons used to get the report or save the current Diagnosis (**4.** on the picture).

Finally, on the right of the screen, there is a free-text panel, where you should put some text which will be in the report (**5.** on the picture). Most of the time, the introduction is used to give the context of this diagnosis, and some info that could be useful when you read the report. You can also put the activity of the organization, and its number of employees.

image::UG_Diagnostic_006.PNG[Main Page – Information about organization with text]

Then, to save your work, you should just hit ‘Record and continue’. In the navigation panel, the theme should be green to indicate that there is already some text.

The summary, which is the last part of the Diagnosis, is a short description of the most important points in it. The most important recommendations, what should be done next…

Those are the only free text fields which are present.

After saving the first information, you will be redirected to the first question.

As you can see in the navigation panel, there are eight big themes, which can contain some questions. The red color is mainly used on the theme where you currently are. The question which is black and bold is the current one. The green one is saved and contains text. By clicking on the main theme, question about it will appear, and then you can go on the questions by clicking on them.

The red cross near the question is to delete the question for this diagnosis.

WARNING: If you make a new one, the question will appear again. If you want to make it disappear for all diagnosis that you make, you should just go in the administration panel to delete it.

image::UG_Diagnostic_007.PNG[Main Page – Navigation Panel]

You can also add questions by clicking the red image:UG_Diagnostic_008.PNG[+ Add a question] button.

WARNING: Be careful, when you do add a question this way, it will be only last during this diagnosis. If you want to add a question for all your diagnoses, you should add it in the administration part.

image::UG_Diagnostic_009.PNG[Add Question]

You will have the question field to add the question as it will appear into the report. The info field is for details which are displayed only for the question creator. It’s useful to add details to the question, or have a reminder of the main points to talk about.

The threshold is a little more difficult to use. To put it simply, this is the multiplication of the threat and weight of the question in the category.

Let’s take an example:

Imagine you need a specific question on the BYOD, and you think this should be really important. Moreover you have, in the same category, a question less important.

If the threshold are respectively 10 (threat 2 * weight 5 for example) and 5 (threat 1 * weight 5 for example), then the maturity on a level is calculated this way: __\((10/3 x maturity) + (5/3 x maturity))__ where the maturity could be 0 if not managed, 1 if more or less managed and 2 if managed. So if a policy is more or less managed about BYOD and the other question is managed, the category will be __\((15/3 x 1) + (10/3 x 2)) = 5 + 6 = 11__ out of 16 (The maximal possible) of maturity for this category.

TIP: The maturity can also be not applicable, i.e. the question is not appropriate for the enterprise. Thereby, the question is not calculated in the final result.

Finally, just hit the green ‘Add’ button to add your new question and get back on the main page.

image::UG_Diagnostic_010.PNG[Main Page – First Question]

On the right side, there is a text field ‘Note’ where you can put what you have seen, what has been said during the interview, precision about what you want…

The maturity panel is where you can set the current maturity on a scale of four levels (managed, more or less managed, not managed and not applicable). You will also have some reminders to think when you ask the question, what you should have in mind when you asking it, and what kind of answer you should have.

The maturity target panel is the maturity level that the company should have. It’s not necessarily managed, so the information security could be adapted from a company to another.

The recommendation panel is the place where you could just put what the company should do to have a better information security.

Finally, the gravity panel is to determine how much the recommendation should be quickly implemented. For saving, as before, just hit ‘Record and continue’.

In the ‘Question’ column, there are all the questions that will appear. The translation key is mainly used to link questions through all languages. The category is, of course, the main theme linked, and the threshold could be assimilated to the maturity that will bring a managed control. The 'Blocking question' column is a way to know if a question is essential for the organization and must be managed. If a blocking question is not managed, it will be displayed in red in the report to highlight it as a problem for the entity. To finish, the ‘action’ column represents the possibility to edit the question (by clicking the pen (image:UG_Diagnostic_012.PNG[Pen])) or delete it (by clicking the cross (image:UG_Diagnostic_013.PNG[Cross])).

Above the tab, there is a section in which you can upload the current questions and categories or export them in a json format.

Files are renamed by the following name:
data_yyyymmddhhnnss.cases where

* y = year
* m = month
* d = day
* h = hour
* n = minutes
* s = second.

There are two ways to load this diagnosis. The first one, at the connection screen, you doesn’t need to have an account to go on it.

image::UG_Diagnostic_001.PNG[Connection Screen]

By doing this, you will have only access to the report this way. It is mostly used to have another quick way to show an overview of the report.
The other way is on the main page that you access just after getting connected.

The first graph that you can see is the maturity by domains with the risk cartography and more precisely with the tab on the right. The colors determine the level of maturity of each category (red when maturity is under 33%, orange between 33% and 66% and green over 66%). If a category is highlighted in orange, it means that it contains a blocking question which is not managed. You will also find the recommendation tab which briefly summarizes the recommendations, their gravity and their current and target maturity.
