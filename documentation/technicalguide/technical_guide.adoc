Set up a virtual host that will point to the *public/index.php* application document root.

Your configuration file should look like this :
----
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName %SERVER_NAME%
    DocumentRoot %ROOT_DIRECTORY%/public
    <Directory %ROOT_DIRECTORY%/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all

        Require all granted
        </IfModule>
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

In addition to that, you may need to edit your *hosts* file.

sudo chmod 2770 ../ROOT_DIRECTORY/data
----

==== Accessing the application from host

If you try to access the application over the network, just set up your virtual host accordingly and don't forget to disable default web application by using :
----
sudo a2dissite 000-default.conf
